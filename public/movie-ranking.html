<h1>MOST FUNNY MOVIES I WATCHED RECENTLY</h1>
<h2>3 Movies i find funny while i watch.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>İzlemeye başlamadan önce böyle olacağına dair hiçbir fikrim yoktu ancak izlerken oldukça güldüğüm yerler oldu. i liked the absurdity.</p>

<h3>What We Do In The Shadows</h3>
<p>Now we all now i have a soft stomach for vampires. But this was something else. i formally met Taika Waititi in this movie. And it was hilarious.</p>

<h3>Luca</h3>
<p>It was a good animation. I liked that it was queer. I wish i saw it when i was a kid. It was funny, galiba 3 kez izledim xd.</p>
